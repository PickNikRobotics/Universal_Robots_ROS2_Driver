# Universal Robots ROS2 Driver

Alpha version of the ROS2 Universal Robots driver. Will be transferred to the Universal Robots organization when ready.


## General driver information

Driver currently only supports position joint interface which means only position-based controllers can be used with 
the ROS2 driver.
[Universal Robots Client Library](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_Client_Library) includes also
velocity-based control whose support will be addressed in additional development of ROS2 driver.


## Requirements

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver#setting-up-a-ur-robot-for-ur_robot_driver) in the paragraph [`Prepare the robot` ](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver#prepare-the-robot).


## Quick Start Instructions

If you are familiar with ROS2, here are the quick-and-dirty build instructions.

  ```
  cd $COLCON_WS
  git clone git@github.com:PickNikRobotics/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver.git src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver
  vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver.repos
  rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths src -y -r
  colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ```
If you end up with missing dependencies, install them using commands from [Setup ROS Workspace](#setup-ros-workspace) section.


### How-to-use Examples

1. Start the driver

   ```
   ros2 launch ur_ros2_control_demos ur5_e_system_position_only.launch.py
   ```

2. Start the `joint_state_controller`:

   ```
   ros2 control load_start_controller joint_state_controller
   ```

3. Start the `forward_command_controller`:

   ```
   ros2 control load_start_controller forward_command_controller_position
   ```

4. Run the test node:

   Run a test node which will publish joint commands on /forward_command_controller_position/commands (std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray) after checking the current joint states (to create minimal increment for safety).
   The node commands increment of 0.1 radians for each joint.
   The commands are incremented in regards to /joint_states found when the node is run.

   ```
   ros2 run ur_ros2_control_demos test_driver
   ```

## Install and Build

### Install ROS Foxy and Development Tooling

These instructions assume you are running Ubuntu 20.04:

1. [Install ROS2 Foxy](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/Linux-Install-Debians/).
   You can stop following along with the tutorial after you complete the section titled: [Environment setup](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/Linux-Install-Debians/#environment-setup).
   Make sure you setup your environment with:
   ```
   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   ```

   > **NOTE:** You may want to add that line to your `~/.bashrc`

   > **NOTE:** There is also a `zsh` version of the setup script.

1. [Install ROS2 Build Tools](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/Linux-Development-Setup/#install-development-tools-and-ros-tools).
   You do not need to build ROS2 from source.
   Simply install the tooling under the section titled "Install development tools and ROS tools".

1. Install `ccache`:
   ```
   sudo apt install ccache
   ```

1. Setup `colcon mixin` [Reference](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository) for convinience commands.
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-mixin
   colcon mixin add default https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/master/index.yaml
   colcon mixin update default
   ```

### Setup ROS Workspace

1. Create a colcon workspace:
   ```
   export COLCON_WS=~/workspace/ros_ws_foxy
   mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
   ```

   > **NOTE:** Feel free to change `~/workspace/ros_ws_foxy` to whatever absolute path you want.

   > **NOTE:** Over time you will propably have multiple ROS workspaces, so it makes sence to them all in a subfolder.
     Also, it is good practice to put the ROS version in the name of the workspace, for different tests you could just add a suffix to the base name `ros_ws_foxy`.

1. Download the required repositories and install package dependencies:
   ```
   cd $COLCON_WS
   git clone git@github.com:PickNikRobotics/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver.git src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver
   vcs import src --input src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver.repos
   rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths src -y -r       # install also is there are unreleased packages
   ```

   Sometimes packages do not list all their dependencies so `rosdep` will not install everything.
   If you are getting missing dependency errors, try manually install the following packages:
   ```
   # ros2_control dependecies
   sudo apt install ros2-foxy-forward_command_controller ros2-foxy-joint_state_controller ros2-foxy-joint_trajectory_controller ros2-foxy-xacro
   # MoveIt dependencies
   sudo apt install ros-foxy-geometric-shapes ros-foxy-moveit-msgs ros-foxy-moveit-resources ros-foxy-srdfdom ros-foxy-warehouse-ros
   ```

### Configure and Build Workspace:
To configure and build workspace execute following commands:
  ```
  cd $COLCON_WS
  colcon build --symlink-install --mixin rel-with-deb-info compile-commands ccache
  ```

## Running Executales

See `README.md` files of the packages for information regarding running executables.

<Add here some concrete data about current repository>

### Using the Local Workspace

To use the local workspace you have to source it by using local setup script:
  ```
  source $COLCON_WS/install/local_setup.bash
  ```
Since there are many errors one unintentionally do with wrong sourcing, please check also [Notes on Sourcing ROS Workspace](#notes-on-sourcing-ros-workspace).

#### Notes on Sourcing ROS Workspace

Sourcing of a workspace appends the binary and resource directories to appropriate enviroment variables.
It is important that you do not run the build command in the same terminal that you have previously sourced your local workspace.
This can cause dependency resolution issues.
Here is some advice copied from [Official ROS Workspace Tutorial](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace/) on this:

Before sourcing the overlay, it is very important that you open a new terminal, separate from the one where you built the workspace.
Sourcing an overlay in the same terminal where you built, or likewise building where an overlay is sourced, may create complex issues.

Sourcing the local_setup of the overlay will only add the packages available in the overlay to your environment.
`setup` sources the overlay as well as the underlay it was created in, allowing you to utilize both workspaces.

So, sourcing your main ROS 2 installation’s setup and then the dev_ws overlay’s local_setup, like you just did, is the same as just sourcing dev_ws’s setup, because that includes the environment of the underlay it was created in.


## Testing and Linting

To test the pacakges packages built from source, use the following command with [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/).
In order to run tests and linters you will have had to already built the workspace.
To run the tests use following commands:
  ```
  cd $COLCON_WS
  colcon test
  colcon test-result
  ```

There are `--mixin` arguments that can be used to control testing with linters, specifically `linters-only` and `linters-skip`.
